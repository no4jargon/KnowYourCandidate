  ## Running the code

  Run `npm i` to install the dependencies.

  Run `npm run dev` to start both the Express API (port `3000`) and the Vite dev server (port `5173`) at the same time. The Vite dev server proxies requests from `/api` to the Express API, so no additional configuration is required for local development.

  If you prefer to run the processes separately, `npm run dev:server` starts only the Express API and `npm run dev:client` starts only the Vite dev server.

  The seeded employer account uses `employer@acme.com` with the password `password123`.
